What is ArityLists ?
	Give information about the number of consecutive occurrences for each elements
Why Recursion Level is required ?


dac :
	ArityLists
	SplitFunctions
	CombineFunctions
	BaseFunctions
	RecursionLevel           (allow us to set up a threshold. You can stop the use of parallel decomposition with this.)
	AlternativeFunctions     (function used when the recursion level is reached)
	Input ---> Output
